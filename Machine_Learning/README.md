# Machine_Learning

BACKGROUND OF OUR PROBLEM
We wanted to use machine-learning and other technologies to be able to predict a movie's success given many different variables, both numerical and categorical.

There are many different variables that can attribute to a movie's success. From actors, to production studios, to budgets, to directors, all of these have a hand at play.

The key challenge was honing in on these variables and not only making them fit our dataset so our model could use them, but also determining which ones were statistically significant. There were many to choose from, from directors and actors all the way to combined Facebook likes for the cast members.

Our datasets of course did not come with the necessary formatting we needed to immediately begin testing our data. We had to perform considerable cleaning in order to get the data up to par.

In order to use machine learning to test our data, we used several different sub-libraries from the Sci-kit Learn library in Pandas. Specifically, we used multi-line linear regressions, decision-tree analysis, and random forest analysis.
